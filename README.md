# Augmented Reality Face Tracking and Overlay System

This project implements a real-time Augmented Reality (AR) face overlay system using Python. It uses OpenCV for video processing, MediaPipe Face Mesh for facial landmark detection, and Pillow for image handling. Users can upload a custom overlay image, remove its background, and place it dynamically on different facial regions (nose, eyes, forehead, mouth, etc.) in real time using a webcam. The overlay automatically resizes based on face dimensions, enabling a smooth and interactive AR experience.
